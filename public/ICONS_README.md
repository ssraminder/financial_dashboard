# PWA Icons Required

The PWA manifest requires the following icon files:

## Required Files:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Online Tools

1. Visit [PWA Builder Image Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)
2. Upload your logo/icon
3. Download the generated icons
4. Place them in the `public/` folder

### Option 2: Favicon Generator

1. Visit [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
2. Upload your logo
3. Generate all icons
4. Extract `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

### Option 3: Manual Creation

1. Create a 512x512 PNG with your app logo/icon
2. Use image editing software to resize to 192x192
3. Save both files in the `public/` folder

## Temporary Solution:

Until you create proper icons, you can use a simple colored square or your company logo resized to these dimensions.

## Design Guidelines:

- Use your brand colors (#1e40af blue)
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Ensure good contrast
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
